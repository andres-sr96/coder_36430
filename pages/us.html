                <h1>Meet us!</h1><br>
                <p>Hello! and welcome to our website. We are Stevie and Laila. For you, to get to know a little more of us, we implemented this section in our website.</p>
                <p>We are originally from Australia and studied web development in TAFE, that's where we both meet, and got to know each other, if it wasn't for an assigment the proffesor task us.</p>
                <p>We both like videogames, for sure! Me, Stevie, I'm more of a pc player while Laila likes to play in consoles. I have many hobbies like reading books, cooking, but the one I love is Tennis. Also Laila likes tennis but her favorite hobbie is collecting videogames. She has an enourmous library of videogames with standard and collectors editions also, beating mine library. Pretty expensive hobbie, if you ask me.</p>

                <h1>How our idea came to life</h1><br>
                <p>Hello, guys. Laila here.</p>
                <p>Maybe you got some insights of how we started this web. Because the proffesor assign us as partnes in a project, we got to know each other.</p>
                <p>We've got this videogames hobbie that we both could relate to. Stevie showed me his entery library of videogames and then I show him mine. Mine was better obviously. And that's where the idea come from. What if we create a webpage that we can login and put the games we've played and share our opinions with everybody. Give our personal rating; our thoughts about their soundtrack, gameplay, character development, etc.</p>
                <p>So, My Game Library is our very first project we both, as partners, started and put a lot of effort on it. We wanted to share our opinions with everyone and that everyone could do it to. So please, feel free to share all of your thoughts.</p>
