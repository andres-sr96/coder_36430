                <p>Netflix has unveiled its plans to prevent password sharing between people in households outside of an account owner's primary location.</p>
                <p>As reported by gHacks, the streaming service has detailed how it aims to crackdown on account sharing in an updated FAQ. The information varies between countries, but it looks like the company will be paying careful attention to the devices used to log in to accounts from now on.</p>
                <p>The FAQ pages for US and UK subscribers currently highlight that devices may require verification if they are not associated with the Netflix household or if they attempt to access an account outside the subscriber's primary location for an extended period of time.</p>

                <p>Sony announced that the PlayStation Plus Collection will be removed from the PlayStation Plus subscription on May 9. However, members can still redeem the titles from the collection until that date and continue to access them afterward as long as they remain subscribers to the service./p>
                <p>The collection has been a perk for PlayStation 5 subscribers since 2020, but it will soon no longer be available. As for the list of games being removed, they are a mix of first and third-party ones.</p>

                <p>James Gunn and Peter Safran have some pretty big plans for connecting the DC Universe (DCU), including video games. But at least one developer is skeptical of this approach.</p>
                <p>Reacting to the news that Gunn and Safran plan to work games into the overall plan for the DCU, Firaxis Games designer Jake Solomon tweeted, "This would have been a nightmare for us on Midnight Suns. I understand the desire (I think) but movies and games are so, so different. And the pressure this puts on the amazing voice actors in the games space? Different universes. And that's how they should/will stay."</p>

                <p>What should have been a celebration of a group clearing the most challenging possible content in Final Fantasy 14: Endwalker has turned into controversy, as the very first team to clear the latest FF14 raid has been accused of cheating.</p>
                <p>The gist is that last week, FF14 patch 6.31 released, including a new, super-hard version of an existing raid: The Omega Protocol. A typical race to be the first raid team in the world to clear it ensued, with a group called Unnamed_ taking the crown on Monday by posting screenshots of their victory. However, not long after, an unlisted video began to circulate showing one of their members using a mod to zoom the camera out much farther than it normally should be able to do, presumably to get a better view on the mechanics. There are also some less-obvious UI mods displayed in the video tracking various elements of the fight.</p>

It's one of those games that we are going to remember, 10, 15, 20 years from now and just say "Wow. That game really did set a new standard". It's THAT good. Play it.</p>

                        I took off one ball, for the lack of Russian localization.
                        It's time to make an animation of steering wheel rotation.
                        And also better delivered dialogues.</p>
